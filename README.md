## Project Proposal: 
1.  The team leader will be Jonathan Heitz (heitzj52@students.rowan.edu)

2.  We will be creating a Trivia questionnare website. There will be multiple quizzes 
    that can be taken, all relating to American popular culture. There will be an automatic 
    grading system, and when a quiz is finished a score will appear for the user to see.

3.  We will be using a basic git workflow. In other words, there will be one central branch, 
    the master branch, and each of us will work on that same branch.
