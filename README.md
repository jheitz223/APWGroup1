## Project Proposal: 
1.  The team leader will be Jonathan Heitz (heitzj52@students.rowan.edu)

2.  We will be creating a Trivia questionnare website. There will be a quiz 
    that can be taken, all relating to American popular culture. There will be an automatic 
    grading system, and when a quiz is finished the user will be shown how many questions they answered 
    correctly and how much time they took. 

3.  We will be using a basic git workflow. In other words, there will be one central branch, 
    the master branch, and each of us will work on that same branch. 

## Instructions:
1.  Run Server.js

2.  Connect to http://localhost:8000

3.  Take the quiz!
