## Project Proposal: 
1.  The team leader will be Jonathan Heitz (heitzj52@students.rowan.edu)

2.  We will be creating a Trivia questionnare website. There will be multiple quizzes 
    that can be taken, all relating to American popular culture. There will be an automatic 
    grading system, and when a quiz is finished, an input box will be displayed showing the user's score 
    and time. There will also be a input system in which users will manually need to enter username, score, 
    and time. This will then be stored in a database and shown in a leaderboard. User's can then check 
    the leaderboard to see top users and scores.

3.  We will be using a basic git workflow. In other words, there will be one central branch, 
    the master branch, and each of us will work on that same branch.
